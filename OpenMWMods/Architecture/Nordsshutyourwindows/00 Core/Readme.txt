II. Description

Original vanilla's nordics windows are closed by wood and the GitG patch give us the chance to make them in glass, glowing at night.
This choice always disturbed me, why couldn't I have both? So here comes "Nords close your windows!".

Now the windows have a wooden shutter, open at day and closed at night.
Maximum immersion still retaining all the GitD options.

The mod folders comes as follows:

  00 - Core Files
            Contains all the required meshes and textures using the SVNR imperial set as base.

  01 - Vanilla style 
            Windows uses the original vanilla stones.

  02 - Interior sunrays
            Adds interior sunrays to the windows.

  03 - Vanilla style sunrays
             Adds interior sunrays to the windows vanilla style.
